# Web Mini Project

This folder contains a small, professional learning site for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each page teaches a topic with short notes and examples, and the styling + JavaScript are shared across the site to keep everything consistent.

## Main pages
- `index.html` - Home page and overview. It links to the three learning pages, shows the learning path, and includes the resources table.
- `HTML.html` - HTML guide. Focuses on semantic structure, forms, accessibility, and metadata.
- `Css.html` - CSS guide. Covers design tokens, layout (Flex/Grid), responsive tips, and polish.
- `JS.html` - JavaScript guide. Covers DOM patterns, events, async basics, and debugging.

## Shared assets
- `css/style.css` - The design system and layout styles for all pages. Includes typography, cards, tables, buttons, and reveal animation styles.
- `js/script.js` - Shared behavior: scroll progress bar, reveal-on-scroll animations, active nav highlight, back-to-top button, and auto-updating footer year.

## Folders
- `css/` - Stores the main stylesheet (`style.css`).
- `js/` - Stores the main script (`script.js`).
- `.dist/` - Build or distribution folder (kept as-is).

## How to run
Open `index.html` in your browser.
